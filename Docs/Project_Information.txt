Deduction Cutoff Date cannot be less than Mercer's Payroll Run Date in the same cycle
All Deduction Cutoff Dates are within the plan year
Deduction Cutoff Date cannot be greater than Deduction Cutoff Date of next pay period.
If Cutoff Date exceeds Mercer's Payroll Run Date - compare config to see if payauto_payroll_config.og_future_dated_events_ind = "Y"
Pay Periods should at least be partially contained in the plan year.
Data: Make sure dates are formatted correctly
Begin Dates should immediately follow the End Dates of the previous pay period
Ensure dates per column are sequential based on the desired pay frequency
Dates from the last cycle from the previous year don't overlap the first cycle of the new year.

1st Last Date has to be 1/2 or greater ... or at least the second day of the plan year
