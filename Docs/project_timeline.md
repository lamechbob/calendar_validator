# ðŸ“… Project Timeline â€“ Payroll Calendar Validation Tool

This document outlines the development and evolution of the Payroll Calendar Validation Tool from inception to full adoption. It highlights major milestones, feature expansions, and measurable results over a six-year period.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2019 â€“ Orientation & System Immersion
- Joined the organization and began splitting time between payroll and configuration.
- Spent the year learning the core payroll engine, how calendars were configured, and how defects were typically reported.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2020 â€“ Root Cause Discovery
- Identified that a majority of payroll defects were tied to misconfigured calendars.
- Noted a gap between requirements documentation and actual database configuration.
- Advocated for calendar validation during both the **requirements phase** and **post-upload phase** to improve accuracy.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2021 â€“ Ad Hoc Validator (Excel-Based)
- Built the first version of the calendar validator using Python to scan Excel files pre-database upload.
- Validated pay periods, date sequences, and frequency logic on request from teams.
- Tool usage was manual and triggered by request â€” mostly in one-off defect prevention scenarios.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2022 â€“ Automation & Weekly Enforcement
- After proving impact, gained leadership buy-in to expand the tool across all clients.
- Transitioned tool to post-upload validation using SQL queries against live database data.
- Added:
  - Weekly scheduling
  - Team-wide error reports via Outlook
  - Smart alerts that emailed only the responsible team if their client had an issue
  - Matplotlib-based charting for visual summaries
- Weekly automation officially began, covering 170+ clients.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2023 â€“ Historical Backups & Deeper Accuracy
- Added backup feature to save calendar snapshots on each run for audit and rollback purposes.
- Refined SQL scripts for better coverage and stability.
- Tool helped reduce reported calendar issues from ~70% to ~20%, with remaining defects tied to true configuration or requirement errors.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2024 â€“ Stability & Visibility
- Tool now runs with minimal intervention and rarely detects errors.
- Broader team has become more educated on payroll configuration rules due to weekly exposure to tool reports.
- Introduced a Power BI dashboard to track errors over time and visualize trends caught by the validator.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2025 â€“ Web Version Launch & Streamlined UX
- Rebuilt the validator as a **web app** using Streamlit, leveraging the same core logic as the original tool.
- New version allows users to upload an Excel file and instantly evaluate calendar dates via a browser interface.
- Hosted on AWS and designed to replicate the functionality of the 2021 Excel validator â€” but with easier access and cleaner UI.
- Original weekly tool continues to run smoothly in parallel, maintaining validation at the database level.
